## Windows 11 21H2 | Windows 10 2004/20H2/21H1/21H2 | LTSC 1809

* The `NotificationAreaIcons`, `TaskbarSize`, `RecentlyAddedAppsAdded` funtions were removed due to lack of necessity;
* Fixed typo in `FileExplorerCompactMode`;
  * The values for `Disable` and `Enable` were switched places by mistake;

* Fixed major in `WinPrtScrFolder` (closes #260);

* Merged #264;
* Added `Spotify` for removing to `UninstallUWPApps`;
* `ShareContext` now uses another method that doesn't have an influence on `Windows10FileExplorer`

  ```

  * And then invoke a new `ShareContext` [(how-to)](https://github.com/farag2/Sophia-Script-for-Windows#how-to-run-the-specific-functions);
* `OpenWindowsTerminalAdminContext` rewritten and now uses a native UAC icon and added to the top-level context menu
  * To revert changes invoke

  ```powershell
  $Items = @(
    "Registry::HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Background\shell\OpenWTHereAsAdmin",
    "Registry::HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shell\OpenWTHereAsAdmin",

## Sophia Script Wrapper 2.5.1

* Cleaned up code: EXE should be now smaller;
* Fixed typos in JSONs;
* Added Spanish (es-ES);

* Now you can download the always latest Sophia Script archive by invoking (`not as administrator too`) in PowerShell console

```powershell
irm script.sophi.app | iex
```

or without using aliases

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri script.sophi.app | Invoke-Expression
```

* The command will download and expand the archive (`without running`) the latest Sophia Script according which Windows and PowerShell versions it is run on. If you run it on Windows 11 via PowerShell 5.1, it will download Sophia Script for `Windows 11 PowerShell 5.1`.

  ```

  * And then invoke a new `Windows10FileExplorer` [(how-to)](https://github.com/farag2/Sophia-Script-for-Windows#how-to-run-the-specific-functions);
* Removed `Windows10FileExplorerRibbon` because I "feel" the classic Windows 10 File Explorer days are near and the code will be removed sooner or later in the next Windows 11 builds;
* Fixed typo in the `MergeConflicts` function: the values were switched places by mistake;

  ```powershell
  # Hide
  New-ItemProperty -Path HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced -Name HideMergeConflicts -PropertyType DWord -Value 1 -Force
  # Show
  New-ItemProperty -Path HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced -Name HideMergeConflicts -PropertyType DWord -Value 0 -Force
